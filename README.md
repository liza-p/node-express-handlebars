MVC stands for Model View Controller
Models are the blueprints of your object, like burger, or place, or user.
Views are what you see, represented by either html pages or a templating engine like Handlebars. There are other ones like EJS.
Controllers are the brains of the application. They connect the models and the views together. Sometimes they are represented by the routes folder.

In a full stack application (or honestly, any backend application), starting point of the application is the server.js. Because we type in node server.js in the terminal to make things run.
